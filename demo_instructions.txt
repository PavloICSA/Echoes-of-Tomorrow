RECOMMENDED CARD SEQUENCE (15–30 seconds)
------------------------------------------

This sequence demonstrates strategic depth, visual variety, and the game's core mechanics:

Turn 1: Play a POSITIVE card (e.g., "Renewable Energy")
  - Effect: Ecology +15, Stability +5
  - Visual: Green waveforms intensify, stability improves
  - Duration: ~2 seconds

Turn 2: Play a MIXED-EFFECT card (e.g., "Tech Innovation")
  - Effect: Innovation +12, Ecology -8
  - Visual: Blue fractals emerge, green waveforms recede slightly
  - Duration: ~2 seconds

Turn 3: Play another POSITIVE card (e.g., "Global Education")
  - Effect: Cohesion +10, Innovation +8
  - Duration: ~2 seconds

Turn 4: Play a RISKY card (e.g., "Industrial Expansion")
  - Effect: Innovation +15, Stability -10
  - Visual: Fractals spike, red instability appears
  - Duration: ~2 seconds

Turn 5–10: Continue playing cards to reach VICTORY
  - Mix positive and mixed-effect cards
  - Avoid negative cards to maintain momentum
  - Aim for all variables ≥80
  - Duration: ~10–15 seconds

Victory Animation:
  - Visualization morphs to balanced green-blue symmetry
  - Victory screen appears with "Golden Future" message
  - Duration: ~3 seconds

---

ALTERNATIVE SEQUENCE: COLLAPSE DEMO (10–15 seconds)
-----------------------------------------------------

If you want to showcase the collapse mechanic:

Turn 1–3: Play NEGATIVE cards (e.g., "Economic Crisis", "Environmental Disaster")
  - Effects: Reduce Ecology, Cohesion, or Stability
  - Visual: Red noise spikes increase, patterns destabilize
  - Duration: ~6 seconds

Turn 4: Play a card that pushes any variable to ≤5
  - Visual: Immediate transition to red static and glitch effects
  - Collapse screen appears
  - Duration: ~2 seconds

RECORDING TIPS
--------------

1. **Frame Rate**: Record at 60 FPS for smooth playback
2. **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (1080p) or 1280x720 (720p) for web distribution
3. **Audio**: 
   - Option A: Mute the game (M key) and add background music in post-production
   - Option B: Keep game audio for procedural ambient tone
4. **Pacing**: Play at normal speed; avoid fast-forwarding
5. **Lighting**: Ensure good screen brightness for visibility
6. **Cursor**: Hide mouse cursor if possible (most recording tools have this option)

POST-PRODUCTION SUGGESTIONS
----------------------------

1. **Title Card** (2–3 seconds):
   - Text: "Echoes of Tomorrow"
   - Subtitle: "A Strategy Game About Shaping Civilization"
   - Background: Fade in from black with game audio or music

2. **Gameplay Footage** (12–20 seconds):
   - Show card selection and variable changes
   - Highlight visual transitions (green waveforms, blue fractals, red instability)
   - Include both victory and collapse sequences if possible

3. **Text Overlays** (optional):
   - "Guide four civilization variables toward victory"
   - "Make strategic choices with lasting consequences"
   - "Reach victory: All variables ≥80 for 5 consecutive turns"
   - "Avoid collapse: Keep all variables >5"
   - "Procedurally-generated visuals, no external assets"

4. **End Card** (2–3 seconds):
   - Text: "Play Now" or "Available Online"
   - Link: echoes-of-tomorrow.itch.io or your hosting URL
   - Background: Fade to black with game audio

5. **Music**:
   - Royalty-free ambient or electronic music (e.g., from Incompetech, YouTube Audio Library)
   - Fade in at start, fade out at end
   - Keep volume lower than game audio if both are used

6. **Transitions**:
   - Use simple cuts or fade transitions between sections
   - Avoid excessive effects; let the game visuals speak for themselves

EXAMPLE SCRIPT
--------------

"Echoes of Tomorrow is a strategy game where you shape civilization's future.

Guide four variables—Ecology, Cohesion, Innovation, and Stability—toward victory.

Each turn, select one of three Echo Cards to influence civilization's trajectory.

Make strategic choices with lasting consequences. Reach victory by maintaining all variables above 80 for five consecutive turns.

Or face collapse if any variable drops too low.

The entire experience is powered by procedurally-generated visuals that evolve in real-time.

Play Echoes of Tomorrow today. No external assets. No build tools. Just pure strategy and procedural beauty."
